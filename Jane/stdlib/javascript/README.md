# JavaScript Standard Library

This document contains the standard practices, conventions, and guidelines for JavaScript development.

## Coding Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons at the end of statements
- Use single quotes for strings
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants

## Error Handling

- Always use try/catch blocks for code that may throw exceptions
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Consider using custom error classes for specific error types

## Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Use Jest as the testing framework
- Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical paths

## Documentation

- Use JSDoc comments for functions, classes, and methods
- Include examples for complex functionality
- Document any non-obvious behavior

## Performance Considerations

- Avoid unnecessary DOM manipulation
- Use efficient data structures and algorithms
- Be mindful of memory usage, especially with closures

## Security Practices

- Never trust user input
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Follow OWASP guidelines for web security

This document serves as a starting point for JavaScript development standards. It should be expanded and refined over time based on project needs and evolving best practices.
