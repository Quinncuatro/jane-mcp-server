# Project Architecture

This document outlines the high-level architecture for Project1, including component structure, data flow, and key design decisions.

## System Overview

Project1 is designed as a microservices architecture with the following main components:

1. **API Gateway** - Entry point for all client requests, handles authentication and request routing
2. **User Service** - Manages user accounts, profiles, and authentication
3. **Content Service** - Handles content creation, storage, and retrieval
4. **Analytics Service** - Collects and processes usage analytics
5. **Notification Service** - Manages notifications and alerts

```

## Data Storage

- User data: PostgreSQL
- Content: Combination of PostgreSQL and object storage
- Analytics: Time-series database (InfluxDB)
- Cache: Redis

## Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- OAuth2 integration for third-party authentication

## Scalability Considerations

- Horizontal scaling for all services
- Database sharding for large tables
- CDN integration for content delivery
- Caching layers for frequently accessed data

## Monitoring & Operations

- Centralized logging with ELK stack
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Automated alerting system

## Deployment

- Containerized deployment with Docker
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- CI/CD pipeline with automatic testing and deployment

## Security Measures

- TLS for all communications
- API rate limiting
- Input validation and sanitization
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Future Considerations

- Geographic distribution for global presence
- Enhanced real-time capabilities
- Machine learning for content recommendations
- Blockchain integration for specific use cases

This architecture is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing for future growth and adaptation as project requirements evolve.
