# Bluetooth Profile Management and A2DP/HFP Switching Logic

## Core Problem Analysis

### Bluetooth Profile Behavior
macOS manages Bluetooth audio devices using multiple profiles simultaneously:
- **A2DP**: High-quality stereo audio output (music, media)
- **HFP**: Low-quality mono bidirectional audio (calls, voice apps)
- **AVRCP**: Media control commands (play/pause/skip)

### Profile Switching Issues
1. **Automatic HFP Activation**: When apps request microphone access, macOS switches to HFP
2. **Failed A2DP Recovery**: After microphone access ends, A2DP doesn't automatically reactivate
3. **Profile Persistence**: Device "remembers" last active profile until forced to re-negotiate

## Solution Strategy: Forced Profile Re-negotiation

### Primary Approach: Disconnect/Reconnect Cycle

#### Theory of Operation
By completely disconnecting and reconnecting the Bluetooth device, we force macOS to:
1. **Tear down existing connections**: Clears all active profiles
2. **Re-evaluate device capabilities**: Rediscovers available services
3. **Re-establish preferred profiles**: Defaults to A2DP for audio output
4. **Reset profile state**: Clears any "sticky" HFP preference

#### Implementation Logic Flow
```bash
# 1. Verify device connection status
check_device_connected()

# 2. Gracefully disconnect device
disconnect_device()

# 3. Wait for clean disconnection
wait_for_disconnection()

# 4. Reconnect device
reconnect_device()

# 5. Verify A2DP profile restoration
verify_profile_restoration()
```

## BluetoothConnector Integration

### Tool Capabilities
BluetoothConnector is a third-party macOS utility that provides:
- Programmatic Bluetooth device connection/disconnection
- Device status checking
- Notification integration
- Reliable MAC address targeting

### Core Commands

#### Device Status Check
```bash
BluetoothConnector --status 0C:E0:E4:86:0B:06
```
**Returns**: Connection status (connected/disconnected/unknown)
**Use Case**: Verify device state before operations

#### Device Disconnection
```bash
BluetoothConnector --disconnect 0C:E0:E4:86:0B:06
```
**Effect**: Cleanly terminates all Bluetooth connections to target device
**Timing**: Typically completes within 1-2 seconds
**Profile Impact**: Clears A2DP, HFP, and AVRCP connections

#### Device Connection
```bash
BluetoothConnector --connect 0C:E0:E4:86:0B:06 --notify
```
**Effect**: Establishes new Bluetooth connection with profile re-negotiation
**Timing**: Typically completes within 3-4 seconds
**Profile Impact**: Re-establishes A2DP as primary audio profile
**Notification**: Optional macOS notification on successful connection

### Error Handling

#### Common BluetoothConnector Errors
1. **Device Not Found**: MAC address not in paired devices list
2. **Device Unavailable**: Target device powered off or out of range
3. **Connection Timeout**: Network interference or device busy
4. **Permission Denied**: Bluetooth system permissions issue

#### Error Detection Patterns
```bash
# Check exit codes
if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
    echo "BluetoothConnector operation failed"
fi

# Parse output for error indicators
if [[ $output == *"not found"* ]]; then
    echo "Device not available"
fi
```

## Timing Optimization

### Critical Timing Parameters

#### Disconnection Wait Period
**Recommended**: 3 seconds
**Rationale**: 
- Allows Bluetooth stack to cleanly tear down connections
- Prevents reconnection while old connection still active
- Accounts for audio system buffer flushing

#### Reconnection Verification Delay
**Recommended**: 2 seconds after connection command
**Rationale**:
- Bluetooth pairing handshake completion
- Profile negotiation time
- Audio system re-initialization

### Implementation Example
```bash
#!/bin/bash
DEVICE_MAC="0C:E0:E4:86:0B:06"
DISCONNECT_WAIT=3
VERIFY_WAIT=2

# Disconnect device
echo "Disconnecting Bluetooth device..."
BluetoothConnector --disconnect $DEVICE_MAC

# Wait for clean disconnection
echo "Waiting for disconnection..."
sleep $DISCONNECT_WAIT

# Reconnect device
echo "Reconnecting device..."
BluetoothConnector --connect $DEVICE_MAC --notify

# Wait for profile establishment
sleep $VERIFY_WAIT

echo "Audio profile restoration complete!"
```

## Profile Verification

### A2DP Restoration Validation

#### Audio Device Detection
```bash
# Check if device appears as audio output
audio-devices list | grep "PLT_BBTPRO"

# Verify device is set as default output
audio-devices output get | grep "PLT_BBTPRO"
```

#### System Profile Inspection
```bash
# Check Bluetooth service status
system_profiler SPBluetoothDataType | grep -A 10 "PLT_BBTPRO" | grep "Services"

# Expected output should show A2DP as active
# Services: 0x800019 < HFP AVRCP A2DP ACL >
```

#### Audio Quality Testing
```bash
# Test with brief audio playback
afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff

# User verification: Does audio sound high-quality (stereo, full frequency range)?
```

## Alternative Profile Management Approaches

### Approach 2: Audio Device Cycling
If BluetoothConnector fails, use audio device switching:

```bash
# Get current audio device
current_device=$(audio-devices output get)

# Switch to built-in speakers temporarily
audio-devices output set "Built-in Output"

# Brief pause for audio system reset
sleep 1

# Switch back to Bluetooth device
audio-devices output set "PLT_BBTPRO"
```

### Approach 3: Bluetooth Service Restart
Nuclear option for severe profile corruption:

```bash
# Warning: Affects all Bluetooth devices
sudo pkill bluetoothd
sudo launchctl start com.apple.bluetoothd
```
**Risk**: Disconnects ALL Bluetooth devices
**Use**: Only as last resort fallback

## Integration Considerations

### macOS Bluetooth Stack Interaction
- **Non-invasive**: Uses public APIs, doesn't modify system files
- **Reversible**: All operations can be undone manually
- **Concurrent Safe**: Won't interfere with other Bluetooth operations

### Audio Application Compatibility
- **iTunes/Music**: May briefly pause, will resume automatically
- **Streaming Apps**: Will reconnect to new audio device automatically
- **Video Calls**: Should not be run during active calls (will disconnect audio)

### Error Recovery Strategies
1. **Retry Logic**: Attempt disconnect/reconnect up to 3 times
2. **Fallback Methods**: Use audio device cycling if Bluetooth commands fail
3. **State Restoration**: Return to previous audio device if operation fails
4. **User Guidance**: Provide clear instructions for manual recovery

## Performance Optimization

### Concurrent Operations
- Avoid multiple simultaneous Bluetooth operations
- Check for existing BluetoothConnector processes before starting
- Queue operations if multiple devices need management

### Resource Management
- Minimal CPU usage during wait periods
- Clean up temporary files/processes
- Proper signal handling for interrupted operations

### Battery Impact
- Minimal additional power consumption
- Quick execution reduces Bluetooth radio active time
- No background processes or polling

This specification provides the technical foundation for implementing reliable Bluetooth profile management that consistently restores high-quality A2DP audio after Google Meet calls and similar microphone-using applications.
