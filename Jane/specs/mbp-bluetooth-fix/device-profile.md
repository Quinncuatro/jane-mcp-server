# Plantronics Backbeat Pro Device Profile and Specifications

## Device Identification

### Primary Identifiers
- **Model Name**: PLT_BBTPRO
- **MAC Address**: `0C:E0:E4:86:0B:06`
- **Vendor ID**: `0x0055` (Plantronics)
- **Product ID**: `0x0113`
- **Firmware Version**: `1.1.0`
- **Minor Type**: Headset

### Bluetooth Classification
- **Device Class**: Audio/Video Device
- **Major Service Class**: Audio
- **Minor Device Class**: Headset
- **Connection Type**: Bluetooth Classic (not BLE)

## Supported Bluetooth Profiles

### Audio Profiles
- **A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile)**: High-quality stereo audio streaming
- **HFP (Hands-Free Profile)**: Bidirectional audio for phone calls and voice applications
- **AVRCP (Audio/Video Remote Control Profile)**: Media control (play/pause/skip)

### Connection Profiles
- **ACL (Asynchronous Connection-Less)**: General data communication
- **Services Value**: `0x800019 < HFP AVRCP A2DP ACL >`

### Profile Behavior Characteristics

#### A2DP Profile (High-Quality Audio)
- **Audio Quality**: High-fidelity stereo (44.1kHz/16-bit typical)
- **Codec Support**: SBC (baseline), potentially AAC/aptX
- **Latency**: ~200-300ms (acceptable for music)
- **Microphone**: Disabled in this mode
- **Use Cases**: Music playback, media consumption
- **Default Behavior**: macOS prefers this profile for audio output when microphone not needed

#### HFP Profile (Hands-Free Communication)
- **Audio Quality**: Low-fidelity mono (8kHz/8-bit typical)
- **Codec**: SCO (Synchronous Connection-Oriented)
- **Latency**: ~20-40ms (optimized for voice)
- **Microphone**: Active and available
- **Use Cases**: Voice calls, video conferencing, voice recognition
- **Trigger Conditions**: Any application requesting microphone access

## Device Connection Behavior

### Normal Connection Sequence
1. **Device Discovery**: Responds to Bluetooth inquiry
2. **Pairing Handshake**: Exchanges cryptographic keys (already completed)
3. **Profile Negotiation**: Establishes available services
4. **Default Profile**: Usually connects with A2DP for audio output

### Profile Switching Scenarios

#### Automatic HFP Activation
**Triggers**:
- Google Meet/Zoom/Teams call initiation
- Voice recording applications
- Siri activation
- Any app requesting microphone permissions

**Behavior**:
- Immediate switch from A2DP to HFP
- Audio quality degrades to mono/low-fidelity
- Microphone becomes active
- AVRCP may remain available for media controls

#### Failed A2DP Recovery (The Problem)
**Expected Behavior**: Automatic return to A2DP when microphone no longer needed
**Actual Behavior**: Device remains in HFP mode even after call ends
**Root Cause**: macOS Bluetooth stack doesn't automatically re-evaluate profile preferences

### Connection State Management

#### Connected State Indicators
- Device appears in Bluetooth menu with "Connected" status
- Audio output destination shows as "PLT_BBTPRO"
- System audio preferences show device as available

#### Profile State Detection
```bash
# Check current audio output device
system_profiler SPAudioDataType | grep -A 5 "PLT_BBTPRO"

# Verify Bluetooth connection status
system_profiler SPBluetoothDataType | grep -A 10 "PLT_BBTPRO"
```

## Hardware Characteristics

### Physical Device Features
- **Form Factor**: Over-ear headphones
- **Battery**: Rechargeable lithium-ion
- **Controls**: Power, volume, play/pause, call answer/end
- **Indicators**: LED status lights, voice prompts

### Connection Stability
- **Range**: Typical 10m (33ft) unobstructed
- **Interference Sensitivity**: Moderate (2.4GHz band)
- **Reconnection Behavior**: Automatic when in range and powered on
- **Multi-device Support**: Can remember multiple paired devices

## Device-Specific Quirks and Behaviors

### Known Issues
1. **Profile Stickiness**: Once switched to HFP, device tends to stay in that mode
2. **Manual Reset Required**: Often requires disconnect/reconnect to restore A2DP
3. **macOS Integration**: Better with dedicated Bluetooth management tools than native controls

### Timing Sensitivities
- **Disconnect Delay**: Requires 2-3 seconds for clean disconnection
- **Reconnect Time**: 3-4 seconds typical for full profile re-establishment
- **Profile Negotiation**: Additional 1-2 seconds for A2DP activation

### Audio Quality Indicators

#### A2DP Mode (Desired State)
- **Frequency Response**: Full range (20Hz-20kHz)
- **Stereo Separation**: Clear left/right channel distinction
- **Dynamic Range**: Good bass response and treble clarity
- **Subjective Quality**: Music sounds "normal" and full

#### HFP Mode (Problem State)
- **Frequency Response**: Limited (300Hz-3.4kHz typical)
- **Audio Channel**: Mono only
- **Dynamic Range**: Compressed, muffled sound
- **Subjective Quality**: Music sounds "like a phone call"

## Integration with macOS

### System Integration Points
- **Audio MIDI Setup**: Device appears in audio device list
- **Bluetooth Preferences**: Shows in connected devices
- **Sound Preferences**: Available as output destination
- **Menu Bar**: Bluetooth icon shows connection status

### API Access Points
- **BluetoothConnector**: Third-party tool for connection management
- **system_profiler**: Built-in tool for device information
- **@spotxyz/macos-audio-devices**: Node.js package for audio device control
- **blueutil**: Alternative command-line Bluetooth utility

## Testing and Validation

### Connection Tests
```bash
# Test device connectivity
BluetoothConnector --status 0C:E0:E4:86:0B:06

# Test audio output routing
audio-devices list | grep PLT_BBTPRO

# Test profile information
system_profiler SPBluetoothDataType | grep -A 15 "PLT_BBTPRO"
```

### Quality Verification
- **A2DP Test**: Play high-quality music, verify stereo and frequency response
- **HFP Test**: Test microphone functionality during calls
- **Switch Test**: Verify profile switching behavior during various applications

## Implementation Considerations

### Device-Specific Optimizations
- **Hardcoded MAC Address**: Use `0C:E0:E4:86:0B:06` for reliable identification
- **Fixed Timing**: 3-second disconnect delay optimized for this device
- **Profile Priorities**: Always prefer A2DP when microphone not actively needed

### Error Handling
- **Device Not Found**: Handle gracefully when headphones are off/disconnected
- **Connection Failures**: Provide meaningful feedback for common failure modes
- **Profile Detection**: Verify successful A2DP restoration after reconnection

This device profile provides the detailed technical foundation for implementing targeted solutions that work reliably with the specific Plantronics Backbeat Pro hardware and its interaction with macOS Bluetooth stack.
