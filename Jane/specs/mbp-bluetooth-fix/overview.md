# MacBook Pro Bluetooth Audio Quality Fix - Project Overview

## Problem Statement

### Core Issue
When using Plantronics Backbeat Pro Bluetooth headphones with a MacBook Pro (M3 Pro, macOS Sonoma 14.4), audio quality degrades significantly after participating in Google Meet calls. The headphones switch from A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile - high-quality stereo) to HFP (Hands-Free Profile - low-quality mono with microphone support) during calls but fail to automatically switch back to A2DP when the call ends.

### User Experience Impact
- **Years-long pain point** affecting daily productivity
- **Manual workarounds** (menu clicking, device cycling) are unreliable
- **Workflow disruption** when switching between calls and music
- **Poor audio quality** makes music and media consumption unpleasant

### Technical Context
- **Device**: Plantronics Backbeat Pro (PLT_BBTPRO)
- **MAC Address**: `0C:E0:E4:86:0B:06`
- **Supported Profiles**: HFP, AVRCP, A2DP, ACL
- **Platform**: macOS Sonoma 14.4 on Apple M3 Pro
- **Trigger**: Google Meet calls requiring microphone access

## Solution Architecture

### Primary Approach: Programmatic Profile Reset
Force Bluetooth profile re-negotiation through controlled disconnect/reconnect cycle:
1. **Detect post-call state** (manual trigger via command)
2. **Graceful disconnect** using BluetoothConnector
3. **Wait for clean disconnection** (3-4 second delay)
4. **Reconnect device** (forces A2DP profile selection)
5. **Verify successful restoration**

### Fallback Strategy: Audio Device Cycling
Use macOS audio device management to force profile reset:
1. **Temporarily switch** to built-in speakers
2. **Switch back** to Bluetooth headphones
3. **Trigger audio system re-evaluation**

### Implementation Goals
- **Sub-10 second execution time**
- **Single command interface** (`fix-audio`)
- **Robust error handling** with meaningful feedback
- **Multiple fallback strategies** for reliability
- **Zero user configuration** required

## Key Technical Requirements

### Reliability Constraints
- Must work consistently after Google Meet calls
- Should not interfere with active audio playback
- Must handle edge cases (device disconnected, multiple audio devices)
- Should provide clear success/failure feedback

### Performance Targets
- **Execution time**: 5-10 seconds maximum
- **Success rate**: >95% in typical post-call scenarios
- **Recovery time**: Immediate A2DP profile restoration

### Integration Requirements
- **Command-line interface**: Simple `fix-audio` command
- **PATH integration**: Available system-wide
- **No GUI dependencies**: Terminal-based solution
- **Minimal dependencies**: Standard tools + BluetoothConnector

## Success Metrics

### Primary Success Criteria
1. **Audio quality restoration**: Return to A2DP high-quality stereo
2. **Consistent execution**: Works reliably in post-call scenarios
3. **User satisfaction**: Eliminates manual workarounds
4. **Performance**: Fast, predictable execution time

### Validation Methods
- Post-Google Meet call testing
- Music playback quality verification
- System audio profile inspection
- User workflow integration testing

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Plantronics Backbeat Pro specific solution
- macOS Sonoma compatibility
- Command-line interface
- Automated Bluetooth profile management
- Error handling and user feedback

### Out of Scope
- GUI applications
- Support for other Bluetooth headphone models
- Windows/Linux compatibility
- Automatic detection of call end events
- Integration with specific video conferencing software

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach
- **Incremental implementation** with multiple fallback strategies
- **Test-driven development** with real-world scenario validation
- **Documentation-first** approach using Jane specifications
- **Multi-session development** with consistent handoffs between Claude Code instances

### Risk Mitigation
- Multiple solution approaches (disconnect/reconnect, audio cycling)
- Comprehensive error handling for edge cases
- Extensive testing with target hardware configuration
- Clear rollback procedures if solutions fail

This specification serves as the foundation for implementing a robust, reliable solution to a years-long Bluetooth audio quality issue, with clear success criteria and comprehensive technical requirements.
