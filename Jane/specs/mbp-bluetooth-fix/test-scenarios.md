- Join Google Meet call (audio switches to HFP automatically)
- End call (audio remains in poor HFP quality)

#### Test Steps
1. Verify audio is in degraded state (mono, muffled)
2. Run `fix-audio` command
3. Verify command completes within 10 seconds
4. Test audio quality restoration (stereo, full frequency range)
5. Verify device shows as connected in Bluetooth menu

#### Success Criteria
- Audio quality restored to high-fidelity stereo
- No manual intervention required
- Consistent behavior across multiple call sessions
- Command execution time ≤ 10 seconds

### Scenario 2: Multiple Video Conference Platforms
**Priority**: High

2. End call, verify HFP persistence
3. Run fix-audio command
4. Verify A2DP restoration

#### Success Criteria
- Consistent behavior across all platforms
- No platform-specific issues
- Audio quality restoration regardless of call duration

### Scenario 3: Rapid Call Succession
**Priority**: Medium

    simulate_hfp_state
    run_fix_audio
    
    local final_state
    final_state=$(get_audio_profile)
    assert_equals "$final_state" "A2DP"

test_execution_time() {
    local start_time end_time duration
    start_time=$(date +%s.%N)
    
    fix_audio_quality
    
    end_time=$(date +%s.%N)
    duration=$(echo "$end_time - $start_time" | bc)
