# Functional and Technical Requirements

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Audio Profile Restoration
**Requirement**: The system must restore Bluetooth audio from HFP (low-quality) to A2DP (high-quality) profile after Google Meet calls.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Audio quality returns to high-fidelity stereo playback
- Music and media sound crisp and clear (not muffled/mono)
- No manual menu navigation required
- Works consistently across multiple call sessions

**Priority**: Critical

### FR2: Single Command Interface
**Requirement**: The solution must be accessible via a single command `fix-audio` from any terminal location.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Command available in user's PATH
- No additional parameters required
- Works from any working directory
- Consistent behavior across terminal sessions

**Priority**: High

### FR3: Fast Execution Time
**Requirement**: The fix must execute within 10 seconds to minimize workflow disruption.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Total execution time ≤ 10 seconds
- Target execution time: 5-8 seconds
- Provides progress feedback during execution
- Fails fast if unable to complete

**Priority**: High

### FR4: User Feedback
**Requirement**: The system must provide clear feedback about operation status and results.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Success/failure status clearly indicated
- Error messages are actionable
- Progress indicators during execution
- Confirmation of audio profile restoration

**Priority**: Medium

### FR5: Error Recovery
**Requirement**: The system must handle common error scenarios gracefully without leaving the audio system in an unstable state.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Recovers from device disconnection scenarios
- Handles multiple Bluetooth devices appropriately
- Does not interfere with other audio applications
- Provides fallback mechanisms when primary approach fails

**Priority**: Medium

## Technical Requirements

### TR1: Platform Compatibility
**Requirement**: The solution must work on macOS Sonoma 14.4 with Apple M3 Pro architecture.

**Specifications**:
- **Operating System**: macOS Sonoma 14.4+
- **Architecture**: Apple Silicon (M3 Pro)
- **Shell**: Bash-compatible
- **Node.js**: Version 18+ (if Node.js implementation used)

**Priority**: Critical

### TR2: Target Device Specifications
**Requirement**: The solution must specifically handle Plantronics Backbeat Pro headphones.

**Device Details**:
- **Model**: PLT_BBTPRO
- **MAC Address**: `0C:E0:E4:86:0B:06`
- **Supported Profiles**: HFP, AVRCP, A2DP, ACL
- **Connection Type**: Bluetooth Classic

**Priority**: Critical

### TR3: Dependency Management
**Requirement**: The solution must minimize external dependencies while ensuring reliability.

**Required Dependencies**:
- BluetoothConnector (via Homebrew)
- Standard macOS utilities (system_profiler, etc.)

**Optional Dependencies**:
- @spotxyz/macos-audio-devices (Node.js package)
- blueutil (alternative Bluetooth management)

**Priority**: High

### TR4: Implementation Language Requirements
**Requirement**: The core solution must be implementable in Bash with optional Node.js components.

**Language Specifications**:
- **Primary**: Bash shell scripting
- **Secondary**: Node.js (for advanced error handling)
- **Compatibility**: POSIX-compliant where possible
- **Error Handling**: Robust error checking and recovery

**Priority**: High

### TR5: Security Constraints
**Requirement**: The solution must not require elevated privileges or compromise system security.

**Security Specifications**:
- No `sudo` requirements
- Uses standard user-level Bluetooth APIs
- No modification of system configuration files
- No network communication required

**Priority**: Medium

## Performance Requirements

### PR1: Execution Speed
**Target**: Complete audio profile restoration within 5-8 seconds under normal conditions.

**Measurements**:
- **Disconnect time**: ≤ 2 seconds
- **Reconnection time**: ≤ 3 seconds  
- **Verification time**: ≤ 2 seconds
- **Total overhead**: ≤ 1 second

### PR2: Resource Usage
**Target**: Minimal system resource consumption during execution.

**Constraints**:
- **CPU Usage**: < 10% during execution
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB total
- **Disk I/O**: Minimal (logging only)
- **Network**: None required

### PR3: Reliability
**Target**: 95%+ success rate in typical post-Google Meet scenarios.

**Metrics**:
- **Success Rate**: >95% under normal conditions
- **Failure Recovery**: 100% of failures should not break audio system
- **Repeatability**: Consistent results across multiple executions

## Compatibility Requirements

### CR1: Audio Application Compatibility
**Requirement**: The solution must not interfere with running audio applications.

**Constraints**:
- Must not interrupt active music playback unnecessarily
- Should preserve volume settings
- Must not affect other Bluetooth devices
- Should work alongside screen sharing and recording apps

### CR2: Bluetooth Stack Compatibility
**Requirement**: The solution must work with macOS Bluetooth implementation without modification.

**Specifications**:
- Uses public Bluetooth APIs only
- Compatible with macOS Bluetooth preferences
- Does not modify Bluetooth configuration files
- Works with existing paired device settings

## Constraints and Limitations

### C1: Hardware Constraints
- **Single Device Target**: Specifically designed for Plantronics Backbeat Pro
- **Platform Specific**: macOS only (Sonoma 14.4+)
- **Architecture**: Apple Silicon optimized

### C2: Usage Constraints
- **Manual Trigger**: Requires user to run command (no automatic detection)
- **Post-Call Timing**: Most effective when run immediately after ending calls
- **Connection State**: Requires device to be connected (or recently disconnected)

### C3: Environmental Constraints
- **Network Independence**: Must work without internet connectivity
- **Permissions**: Must work with standard user permissions
- **Interference**: Should handle other Bluetooth devices appropriately

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Maintainability
- Code must be clearly documented and commented
- Modular design to support multiple solution approaches
- Clear separation between Bluetooth management and user interface

### NFR2: Extensibility  
- Design should support addition of other headphone models
- Architecture should accommodate new fallback strategies
- Logging framework for debugging and improvement

### NFR3: Usability
- Command should be memorable and intuitive
- Error messages should guide user toward resolution
- Minimal learning curve for basic usage

This requirements specification provides the foundation for implementing a robust, user-friendly solution to the Bluetooth audio quality degradation issue.
