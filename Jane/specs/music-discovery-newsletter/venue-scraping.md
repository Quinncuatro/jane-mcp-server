# Venue Scraping Specification

## Target Venue
**College Street Music Hall**
- URL: https://collegestreetmusichall.com/calendar/
- Calendar Type: Web-based calendar interface
- Data Range: Next 30 days from current date

## Scraping Requirements

### Data Extraction
Extract the following fields for each event:
- **Event Date**: ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Event Time**: 24-hour format (HH:MM)
- **Artist/Band Name**: Primary performer
- **Supporting Acts**: Opening bands (if listed)
- **Ticket Price**: Price range or single price
- **Age Restrictions**: All ages, 18+, 21+, etc.
- **Ticket URL**: Direct link to purchase tickets
- **Event Description**: Any additional details

### Technical Implementation
- **Method**: Python with requests + BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing
- **Rate Limiting**: 1-second delay between requests
- **User Agent**: Rotate between common browser user agents
- **Timeout**: 10-second timeout per request
- **Retries**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff

### Data Quality Standards
- Events must have at least: date, artist name, and venue confirmation
- Dates must be within the next 30 days
- Duplicate events (same artist, same date) should be filtered out
- Handle common HTML entities and encoding issues

### Error Handling
- **Network Errors**: Retry with backoff, log error, continue with partial data
- **Parse Errors**: Log specific parsing failure, attempt to extract partial data
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect any 429 responses, implement exponential backoff
- **Empty Results**: Log warning but don't fail the entire pipeline

### Output Format
```python
{
    "venue": "College Street Music Hall",
    "date": "2025-07-15",
    "time": "20:00",
    "artist": "Turnover",
    "supporting_acts": ["Special Guest"],
    "price": "$25",
    "age_restriction": "All Ages",
    "ticket_url": "https://...",
    "description": "Indie rock band from Virginia..."
}
```

### Future Venue Extensibility
- Design scraper interface to easily add new venues
- Each venue should have its own scraper class implementing common interface
- Configuration-driven venue definitions for easy addition
