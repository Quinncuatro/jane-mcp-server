# Music Discovery Newsletter System

## Overview

An AI-powered system that scrapes local music venues in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island to create engaging newsletters about upcoming shows. Built with LangGraph for orchestrated agent workflows.

## Project Goals

- Scrape College Street Music Hall (and eventually other venues) for upcoming events
- Enrich event data with artist information from Spotify
- Generate newsletter content with authentic local New Haven tone
- Send email newsletters with show recommendations
- Build foundation for multi-venue, multi-subscriber system

## Target Audience

Local music fans in the New Haven area and broader Connecticut music scene who want insider knowledge about upcoming shows.

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: LangGraph (Python) for agent orchestration
- **LLM**: Claude for content generation, GPT for data processing
- **Data Sources**: Venue websites, Spotify API
- **Email**: Python smtplib for sending
- **Storage**: JSON for inter-node data passing
- **Scheduling**: Built-in cron-like functionality

## MVP Scope

1. Scrape College Street Music Hall calendar (next 30 days)
2. Enrich events with Spotify artist data
3. Generate newsletter content with local tone
4. Send email to single test recipient (quinncuatro@gmail.com)
5. Support both manual runs and scheduled execution
6. Comprehensive error handling

## Content Tone Guidelines

- Write as a local New Havener (not Yale-affiliated)
- Insider knowledge of venues and local scene
- Authentic Connecticut/New England voice
- Enthusiastic but not trying too hard
- Include practical show recommendations
- Reference local culture naturally

## Future Expansion

- Multiple venue support (The Webster, Worcester Palladium, Lupo's successor)
- Multi-subscriber email management
- Social media posting (Instagram, Reddit)
- User preference learning
- Advanced content personalization
